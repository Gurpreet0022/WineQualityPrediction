# Wine Quality Prediction

This project is a **Wine Quality Prediction model** developed to explore fundamental concepts in **Machine Learning**. Using a dataset of wines with various chemical properties, this project aims to predict wine quality ratings based on these features.

## Project Overview

The Wine Quality Prediction model applies machine learning techniques to classify wines by quality. By analyzing key chemical characteristics, the model provides insights into how these properties influence quality ratings, helping users understand and predict wine quality effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:
- **Fixed Acidity**
- **Volatile Acidity**
- **Citric Acid**
- **Residual Sugar**
- **Chlorides**
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide**
- **Total Sulfur Dioxide**
- **Density**
- **pH**
- **Sulphates**
- **Alcohol**
- **Quality** (target variable)

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features for quality prediction.
3. **Model Training**: Using supervised machine learning algorithms to classify wine quality.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## Objective

This project familiarizes users with machine learning workflows, data preprocessing, and classification modeling, making it ideal for those beginning their ML journey.
